/* Music Room framework — THE shared file for every app.
   Settings + persistence, colour system + Boomwhacker note grid, audio engine,
   5-touch input, menu panels, presets, session lock, lifecycle/render loop.
   Each app supplies an Anim object (see template.html) and calls boot().
   Loaded via <script src> so it works from file:// (offline / USB stick).
   The app supplies an `Anim` object with:
     themes, defaults, schema, sectionLabel, init(canvas), resize(w,h),
     splat(x,y,dx,dy,color,opts), frame(dt), reset()
   plus optional hooks: styles, railButtons, setQuality, buildInstrument,
   buildVisuals, buildApp, appLabel, setupExtras, soundExtras, onCell, lockMode,
   hideRail, paneLabels, bandColor.
   Coordinates passed to splat() are normalised 0..1 with y pointing UP.

//
// The second alternated on the note's DEGREE IN THE SCALE, which fixed that: a C

// quieter version of itself, it makes it A DIFFERENT COLOUR: D at full strength
// is hue 28 degrees at 53% lightness and reads as orange, and at 0.35 it is the

// orange" - the palette was right and the dimming was wrong.
//
// So Bold changes no hue and dims no key. Every key is drawn at full strength,
// which is what lifts it off the background, and neighbouring keys are told
// apart by a DARK SEPARATOR between them rather than by luminance. Colour
// identity is preserved exactly; the separation stops depending on colour at

// `Lines only` and `Invisible` are gone from the row. Invisible duplicated what
// switching to flow mode already does, and the apps that hide their keyboard
// (Big Switch, MIDI Light, Sound Match) set `zoneLook:'off'` internally and never

// Boomwhacker is drawn at full strength and separated by a DARK gap rather than
// by dimming alternate keys. Two attempts at alternating the brightness are
// recorded here because both were wrong:
//
//   - alternating on the COLUMN INDEX made the first C bright and the second C
//     dark on an 11-key scale. The same note in two colours, which is the one
//     thing the Boomwhacker convention cannot survive.
//   - alternating on the note's DEGREE fixed that, and still failed: dimming a
//     colour to 0.35 does not make a quieter version of it, it makes A DIFFERENT
//     COLOUR. D is hue 28 at 53% lightness and reads as orange; at 0.35 it is the
//     same hue at 18% and reads as BROWN. The user: "D looks brown rather than
//     orange." The palette was right; the dimming was wrong.
//
// So nothing is dimmed to make room for its neighbour. Every key is its own
// colour at full strength - measured 3.39:1 to 12.55:1 against the background,
// where the shipped keyboard was 1.12:1 - and the dark separator does the
// separating, which is also what makes it work for a colour-blind student.

// what the STUDENT experiences; there was nowhere for the things a therapist
// sets once per room — how big the controls are, how hard the machine works.
// They were buried in the Visuals pane's Fine-tune drawer, which is a strange
// place to look for "the text is too small to read". (That drawer is itself
// gone as of Phase 4c; this pane is where its refugees landed.)
//
// This pane is also where phase 2's switch-access controls land. They have no
// sensible home in the other four, and burying an ACCESS setting in a drawer is
// how a student ends up unable to play.
// ── Setup → Access: three tabs, one honest job each ──────────────────────────
// Controller · Mouse · Buttons. They are TABS, not a mode switch: every device
// stays live whichever one is showing, because a therapist on the mouse and a
// student on the stick is the normal case and not a conflict. The pane's old
// flat list said nothing at all about a mouse, and silence reads as "not
// supported". See PHASE-5C-ACCESS-PANE.md.

// The chosen tab is deliberately NOT a setting: it is where the therapist is
// looking, not something about the student, so it never rides in a preset.

  // preset; Menu size is this DISPLAY's and never does; Performance and Show
  // performance are the developer's. So: student, display, machine.
  //
  // Fullscreen breaks that on purpose and goes FIRST. It groups with Menu size
  // by ownership - both answer "what is this screen like" - and that is how it
  // used to be ordered. But it is reached for often when a machine is being set
  // up (the user's report from the room, 2026-08-30), and burying a control that
  // gets used to keep a grouping tidy is the wrong trade. The pane opens on its
  // first control, so the thing most likely to be wanted is the thing in view.
  //
  // "Start over" is gone from this pane entirely. Defaults IS a preset, so it
  // lives in the preset list as ↺ Defaults — see applyDefaults().
  //
  // The hint ELEMENTS stay, deliberately: each carried a FAILURE message as well
  // as an explanation, and only the explanations were asked for. Menu size still
  // has to say when the size asked for does not fit this screen, or the slider
  // looks broken; Fullscreen still has to say when the browser refused, or the

  // is wrong. `uiScale` and the `ui-scale` key are unchanged — this is a label.

// pixel-perfect, not a scaled image. Anything the chrome takes shows up as a
// smaller, centred activity.
//
// The REACH AREA is the deliberate exception to that, and the only thing
// allowed to scale a locked session: a smaller activity a student can reach
// beats a crisper one they cannot. It is the same three numbers, answered
// differently - reachSize scales k, and reachX/reachY place the centre instead
// of centring it. At 1, 0.5, 0.5 the arithmetic below is identical to the
// (r.width-w*k)/2 it replaces, so an install that never touches the feature
// produces the same transform string and nothing re-renders.

// ── Place it: dragging the activity to where the student can reach ────────────
// The therapist is looking at a wall, not at a laptop, so the position is set by
// dragging the thing itself. Three number fields would be simple to build and
// impossible to aim.
//
// The drag is taken by an OVERLAY over the slot, never by the canvas, and that
// one decision settles three problems at once:
//
//   * no note can sound while placing. The framework's pointer path is never
//     entered, rather than entered and then suppressed - there is no half-state
//     for onUp to miss and nothing to get stuck down.
//   * the drag arrives in SLOT pixels, the space fitSurface() already works in,
//     so a delta is dx/r.width and there is no inverse transform anywhere.
//   * fitSurface() keeps running during the drag, so the activity follows the
//     finger live. It bails while pointers.length is non-zero - the rule that
//     stops a re-scale under a student's hand mid-note - and a place drag
//     registers no framework pointer at all. Safe for the reason that rule
//     exists: there is no note to move out from under.
//
// Place mode is NOT a setting. It is where the therapist is, not something about
// the student, so it never rides in a preset - the same rule as accessTab.
